# pubsub-playground
Basic batch publisher/subscriber worker template for experimenting with PubSub.
Configure the amount of messages you want to send in a single run via the
`PUB_COUNT` env variable.

If you do not already have a test topic/subscription set up, you can configure
them using the included shell scripts.
